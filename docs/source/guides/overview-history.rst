Overview
========

The National Library of New Zealand has a legal mandate, and a social responsibility, to preserve New Zealand's social
and cultural history, be it in the form of books, newspapers and photographs, or of websites, blogs and videos.
Increasing amounts of New Zealand's documentary heritage is only available online. Users find this content valuable and
convenient, but its impermanence, lack of clear ownership, and dynamic nature pose significant challenges to any
institution that attempts to acquire and preserve it.

NLNZ develops software to assist in its mission. This software is developed by a variety of people, from in-house
dedicated software developers to library staff writing code for their specific workflow to projects developed in
collaboration with other institutions to external vendors.
